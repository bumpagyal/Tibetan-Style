== Description ==
This plugin is for the problem that WordPress default Tibetan font is too small on Windows system. When the user does not install any Tibetan font, "Noto Sans Tibetan" is used as the default font to display Tibetan, instead of "Microsoft Himalaya" font. If it is an operating system such as a Mac, the default font body of the system will be called.
